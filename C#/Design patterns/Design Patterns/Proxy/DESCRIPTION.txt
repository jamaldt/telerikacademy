The Proxy pattern supports objects that control the creation of and access to other
objects. The proxy is often a small (public) object that stands in for a more complex
(private) object that is activated once certain circumstances are clear.

Proxy is one of the basic design patterns. It is an object that you insert in place of the "real"
object in order to provide additional or different operations—these usually involve
communication with a "real" object, so a proxy typically acts as a go-between.
