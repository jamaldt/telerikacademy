The Iterator pattern provides a way of accessing elements of a collection sequen-
tially, without knowing how the collection is structured. As an extension, the pat-
tern allows for filtering elements in a variety of ways as they are generated.

The Sequence is simply a fixed-sized array of Object with a class wrapped around it. You
call add( ) to add a new Object to the end of the sequence (if there’s room left). To fetch
each of the objects in a Sequence, there’s an interface called Selector.

Because Selector is an interface, other classes can
implement the interface in their own ways, and other methods can take the interface as an
argument, in order to create more general-purpose code.
