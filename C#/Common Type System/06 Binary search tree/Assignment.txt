    Define the data structure binary search tree with operations for:
    - adding new element
    - searching element
    - deleting elements

    It is not necessary to keep the tree balanced. Implement the standard methods 
from System.Object:
    - ToString()
    - Equals(…)
    - GetHashCode() 
    - operator ==
    - operator !=

    Remark: Use two types:
    - structure BinarySearchTree (for the tree)
    - class TreeNode (for the tree elements). 
    
    Implement IEnumerable<T> to traverse the tree.
    Implement ICloneable interface for deep copy of the tree.
