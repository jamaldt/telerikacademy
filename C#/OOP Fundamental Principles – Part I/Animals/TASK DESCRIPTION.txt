    Create a hierarchy Dog, Frog, Cat, Kitten, Tomcat and define useful 
constructors and methods. Dogs, frogs and cats are Animals. All animals can 
produce sound (specified by the ISound interface). Kittens and tomcats are
cats. All animals are described by age, name and sex. Kittens can be only 
female and tomcats can be only male. Each animal produces a specific sound. 
Create arrays of different kinds of animals and calculate the average age of
each kind of animal using a static method (you may use LINQ).
